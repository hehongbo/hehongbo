**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹\
**I'm Hongbo.**

I'm a software engineer and prototype designer of [Kurz Kurz Design (China)](https://kkdesign.cn).

I'm also:
- a coffee lover.
- a UNIX lover and macOS user.
- Hackintosh user. 
- DIY lover, particularly in electronics.
- hobbyist of DevOps, automation and Docker.
- not fans of Apple but fans of great product designs.

Checkout my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/HongboChn). That's where I archive these delightful moments around me.

*p.s. I may not have so much to show here. You may visit our company's website, that's a collection of great products (or works) our talented colleagues have designed.*

*Of course, I coded the entire website by myself.*
